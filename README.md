# Hurricane Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing hurricane data. The analysis includes calculations related to damages, names, months, deaths, affected areas, maximum sustained winds, and years of recorded hurricanes.

## Key Conclusions

Before diving into the details, here are the key conclusions from the hurricane data analysis:

### Damages Analysis

The recorded damages are updated, with values converted to numerical formats (in dollars) for further analysis.

### Creating a Hurricane Data Table

A table of hurricane data is created, organized by hurricane names, months, years, maximum sustained winds, affected areas, and deaths.

### Organizing Data by Year

The hurricane data is organized by year, making it easier to track patterns and statistics over time.

### Counting Damaged Areas

The number of times each area is affected by hurricanes is counted, providing insights into the most frequently impacted regions.

### Calculating Maximum Hurricane Count

The area most frequently affected by hurricanes is identified, along with the number of hurricanes involved.

### Calculating the Deadliest Hurricane

The deadliest hurricane is determined, along with the number of deaths it caused.

### Rating Hurricanes by Mortality

Hurricanes are rated by mortality severity, categorizing them into different scales based on the number of deaths.

### Calculating Hurricane Maximum Damage

The hurricane that caused the highest damage is identified, along with the total cost of damages.

### Rating Hurricanes by Damage

Hurricanes are rated by damage severity, categorizing them into different scales based on the cost of damages.

## Usage

You can use the provided Python code to analyze hurricane data and gain insights into various aspects of these natural disasters.
